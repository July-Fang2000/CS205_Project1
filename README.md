## Introduction

The eight puzzle problem consists of a 3Ã—3 board with eight uniquely numbered pieces, ranging from 1 to 8, and an empty space. Adjacent pieces can be moved into the empty space. The objective is to find the shortest sequence of moves required to transform the initial configuration into a target configuration. Each configuration represents a particular arrangement of the pieces on the board. By moving the pieces, the configurations change, and the puzzle is solved by determining a series of intermediate configurations that lead from the initial to the target state. In this project, I will not only try a single eight puzzle problem, but also extend to more general problems, such as 15-puzzle, 24-puzzle, etc. I used python to complete this project and the full code can be seen at the end of the report.

## Algorithms

### Uniform Cost Search

Uniform Cost Search is an algorithm used to solve the Eight Puzzle by exploring the state space and finding the optimal solution with the least cost. It is a variant of the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, where the priority of expanding nodes is based on the path cost to reach each node.

### A\* with the Misplaced Tile heuristic

The Misplaced Tile heuristic estimates the remaining cost to reach the target state by counting the number of tiles that are not in their correct positions. In other words, it counts the number of tiles in the current state that are different from their corresponding positions in the target state.

### A\* with the Manhattan Distance heuristic

The Manhattan distance heuristic estimates the remaining cost to reach the target state by summing the Manhattan distances of all the tiles in the current state. The Manhattan distance of a tile is defined as the distance between its current position and its target position, measured along the horizontal and vertical axes.

## Conclusion

It is evident that uniform search can be computationally expensive as it requires expanding and checking all nodes in the search space. On the other hand, A* algorithms show better performance. Specifically, A* with the Manhattan distance heuristic outperforms A* with the Misplaced Tile heuristic, especially in scenarios where the problem can be solved with a low number of moves. In such cases, the two A* algorithms exhibit similar performance. However, when the problem has a high depth or requires a significant number of moves, A\* with the Manhattan distance heuristic proves to be superior in terms of efficiency and effectiveness.
